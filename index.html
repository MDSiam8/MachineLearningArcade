                <p>Revisit your childhood memories, except this time, with a twist: instead of traditional controls, you literally use your hand! The rules of this game are simple: you control a paddle and must not let the ball hit the side of your screen; simultaneously, your goal is to make the ball hit the opponent's end of the screen. Whoever gets 15 points first wins. As an additional twist, the ball gets faster each passing moment, so as to keep you on edge! Just a warning: this game is very difficult to win!</p>

                <p>In this game, you, the Player, are a very hungry creature and your goal is to eat as much "orbs" as possible. Every time you eat an orb, your body shall grow bigger, and you must try and eat as much as you can without eating yourself. The modus operandi for playing this is your face: look up or down if you want the player to go up or down, face left or right if you want the player to go left or right.</p>
